Enyata template for next projects

<br >

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with basic setup like Eslint, React-testing library and Tailwind.

## Getting Started

First, to install, run the development server:


```bash
npm install
# or
yarn
```

To run on dev

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```



Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.


[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

To run on test

```bash
npm run test
# or
yarn test
```
